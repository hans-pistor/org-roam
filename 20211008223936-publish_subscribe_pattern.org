#+title: Publish-Subscribe Pattern
#+filetags: design-patterns

In the publish-subscribe (pubsub) pattern, publishers push messages into an event channel & subscribers read messages from that event channel.

This is separate from the [[id:fb1238f5-1c21-4dcf-b4c6-1d67e36b95de][Observer Pattern]] pattern because neither the producer or subscriber has to know about the othe, only the event channel

Typically event channels include a [[id:bf35ec81-e546-4707-9b7b-3d24863a5762][Message Broker]]
