#+title: Observer Pattern
#+filetags: Design-Patterns

The observer pattern lets some ~Subject~ keep track of all of its dependents (~Observers~) and notify them all of some event.

One drawback of the observer pattern is that the Observer and the Subject have to know of each other. This causing some coupling between subjects and their observers.


#+begin_src java
public interface Subject<T> {
    void registerObserver(Observer<T> observer);
    void deregisterObserver(Observer<T> observer);
    void notifyObservers(T event);
}

public interface ObserverMT> {
    void observe(T event);
}
#+end_src
